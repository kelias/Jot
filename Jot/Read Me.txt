Thanks for taking a Look at Jot!


BUILDING JOT----------------------------

Before you build Jot install the font BIRTH OF A HERO.ttf. This is in Jot\trunk\src\Jot\Jot\Fonts

Then just build in Visual Studio.


NOTES-----------------------------------

When you run Jot it will save your notes in the bin folder in a file called Notes.jot.
